   <p>The figure shows Australian energy consumption, energy intensity and energy productivity as an index 
     from 2008-2009 to 2018â€“19. As economic growth in Australia over recent decades has generally outpaced growth in energy consumption,
      the Australian economy has tended towards lower energy intensity and higher energy productivity over time.</p>
