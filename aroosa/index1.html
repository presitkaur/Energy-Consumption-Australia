    <p> The population of Australia represents 0.33 percent of the world´s total population which arguably means that one person in every 308 people on the planet is a resident of Australia.</p>
      <p>This graph shows Australian population is increasing over the past years. With this increase in population there is an increase in the
         GDP.</p>
       <br><strong> How does population growth affect GDP growth?</br></strong>
       <br>
        <p> In economics, labour is a factor of production and with an increase in the labour force, due to population growth, the total output may increase causing the GDP to increase. The wages for labour may also decrease due to an abundance of labour, this would allow the cost of production to decrease.
