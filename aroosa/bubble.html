   <p>TThe relationship between energy use and economic output can be described in terms of the energy intensity, or inversely, 
       the energy productivity, of the Australian economy. Energy intensity measures the amount of energy used to produce a unit of 
       economic output (energy consumption/GDP), while energy productivity measures the amount of economic output produced per unit of 
       energy input (GDP/energy consumption).</p>
<p> 
    The Australian economy has tended towards lower energy intensity and higher energy productivity over time, as economic growth in Australia 
    over recent decades has generally outpaced growth in energy consumption . This reflects cumulative improvements in energy
    
    efficiency as well as a shift in the Australian economy away from highly energy-intensive industries such as manufacturing towards less
     energy-intensive industries such as services. Increased use of renewable energy instead of fossil fuels for electricity generation has a
     lso had a positive impact on energy productivity. Energy productivity improved by 2.0 per cent in 2017â€“18. Australia now creates $294 million in GDP for every petajoule of energy consumed</p>
